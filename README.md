# Background
 This bot was created in response to a discord server which had a large number of users who were using the poker now discord app
 as well as a significant number of user who were not. A problem arose when we wanted to add chips to all users playing without having to repeat the command for adding chips each time for every user. The code below creates a bot which calls the command for
 adding chips to all current players using a single command.
